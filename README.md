Hopefully, a suitable model will emerge for this to become a singleton model.

Dinesafe (Durham)

Nicely puts all (approx 3000) inspection links on a single page

InfoDine - Niagara (12 regions)
---

More involved than Durham region as there are 12 inspection sites instead of one

https://github.com/openciti/dinesafe/blob/master/config/initializers/app_regional/infodine/niagara_pwner.rb

    - gets the 12 regional urls from the infodine homepage
    - creates a directory structure with a timestamp as the root and
        with a subfolder for each region
    - blasts through each regional site to get inspection urls
    - saves the eventual desired file path and the url in the Grab
        model for later processing
    - TODO start a cron task to perform scraping on the over 3000 inspection urls
    - TODO write the final scraper

Yorksafe - York region
---

Not hard to request all records in one page by setting &page-size=-1

pwner:
https://github.com/openciti/dinesafe/blob/master/config/initializers/app_regional/york/york_pwner.rb

scraper: TODO
